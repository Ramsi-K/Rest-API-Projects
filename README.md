# Rest-API-Projects
This repository contains my projects from the REST API Development with Flask course on Udemy. It focuses on building production-ready REST APIs using Python, Flask, and Docker, Flask-Smorest, and Flask-SQLAlchemy, covering user authentication, database interactions, and deployment strategies, showcasing my learning journey.


# REST API Development with Flask

This repository contains my work and projects from the **REST API Development with Flask** course on Udemy. The course, taught by Jose, is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of building production-ready REST APIs using Python, Flask, Docker, Flask-Smorest, and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

## Course Objectives

Throughout this course, I aim to achieve the following:

- Develop resource-based, production-ready REST APIs.
- Implement secure user authentication and registration.
- Utilize SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- Explore deployment strategies using Docker.
- Understand the intricacies of web applications and how they communicate.

## Projects and Learning Outcomes

As I progress through the course, I will be working on several key projects, including:

1. **User Authentication API**
   - A project focusing on secure user registration and JWT authentication.

2. **Resource Management API**
   - Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing resources within a database.

3. **Docker Deployment**
   - Setting up Docker to facilitate the deployment of my REST APIs.

## Installation and Setup

Instructions for setting up the projects will be documented here as I complete them.

## Summary

I am excited to enhance my skills in web development and API integration through this course, and I look forward to showcasing my projects in this repository as I progress.
